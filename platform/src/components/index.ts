// The `sst` global: what SST's components share, and the components for each
// provider. A file imports the same from `sst/components` and from each
// group, like `sst/components/aws`. A new group goes here, in groups.ts, in
// the CLI's PlatformModules (pkg/js) and in the vitest alias
// (testing/vitest.ts), and tests check that they agree.
