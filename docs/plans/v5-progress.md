# v5 progress log

What landed, in which commit, and what was learned on the way. The plan is in [v5-components.md](v5-components.md); the details of each port are in [v5-port-notes.md](v5-port-notes.md).

Components are named as they are now. Until 2026-10-01 they had a `V5` suffix (`QueueV5` in `aws/queue-v5.ts`, type `sst:aws:QueueV5`), which is why older commit subjects read that way.

## 2026-09-30

### The foundation

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `8160600c1` | `bun run build:cli` on `v5` writes `dist/sst5`, labelled `sst-community-v5`, next to the stable `dist/sst` built from `main`. |
| `ac09ec21e` | Components are built from declared parts: `component()`, `this.part()`, the markers, `existing`, `nodes`, the takeover registry, deep-merging transforms, naming rules as data. |
| `3796db97e` | `Queue`, `Redis`, `SnsTopic`, `ApiGatewayV2`, `Bucket`, `CognitoUserPool` (with its client) and `AppSync`. |
| `90bf9c04d` | `Function`, the test of whether the framework holds for the hardest component. It did. |
| `7ab67749f` | The docs generator renders v5 pages: `transform`, `existing` and `nodes` from the `parts` declaration, each with the part's doc comment. |
| `29cf0d2ed` | Fork-owned files import without `.js`. |
| `321891279` | Functions inside v5 components are v5 functions, created with `functionPart()`. |
| `2bb7d3b24` | `Dynamo`. |
| `ab664bf0a` | The object form of a part's `transform` is typed the way it merges (`PartialArgs<T>`). |

Where the files are, in `platform/src/components/`:

- `component.ts`: the base class every component extends (naming, `$transform`). Close to `main`.
- `parts-component.ts`: `component()` and the `PartsComponent` class it returns, which holds all the parts logic.
- `parts.ts`: the parts types and markers.
- `transform.ts`: `transform()` (4.x, shallow) and `transformPart()` / `mergeArgs()` (deep).
- `naming-rules.ts` and `naming.ts`: the built-in naming tables as data, and what applies them.
- `args.ts`: `withDefault`, `ifSet`, `plain`, `plainDeep`, `notAnOption`, `Plain<T>`, `withoutDependencies`.
- `takeover.ts` and `aws/takeover/`: the registry, and each component's map.

### The test harness

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `98715bd69` | URNs are built from the whole chain of parents. Pulumi's mock used only the immediate parent's type, so three levels deep a nested takeover looked like it deleted the function. |
| `13163848e` | `Dynamo` is checked inside another component and with a `provider`. An unknown field type is created as binary again, as 4.x does. |
| `8729f83b6` | The takeover check compares the options that change what a deploy does: `ignoreChanges`, `protect`, `retainOnDelete`, `deleteBeforeReplace`, `replaceOnChanges`, `additionalSecretOutputs` and the provider. Before this a port that dropped `ignoreChanges: ["engineVersion"]` would have passed. |
| `33335e5b1` | `Postgres`. |

Checked in the engine's source (`step_generator.go`): a resource's duplicate aliases are deduped, an alias equal to its own URN is skipped, and an alias that matches nothing is ignored.

`v5` was pushed for the first time at `ab664bf0a`.

## 2026-10-01

### Databases, schedules and tasks

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `3dd98284b` | `aws/helpers/rds.ts`: what any RDS database needs (storage limit, replicas, proxy credentials, role and args, the stored password). |
| `d05848b71` | `Mysql`. |
| `fb6c459b5` | `Aurora`. The framework gained `lookupPart()`, to look a part up by an id the component works out. |
| `d6ba8cc68` | The harness leaves a resource's own name alone in its own inputs. It had been rewriting a renamed resource's new name to the old one everywhere, which hid a `Name` tag made from the new logical name. |
| `3d4b553b2` | `Dsql`. |
| `bcd32ab62` | Every "Switch from" section says that an object `transform` is merged deeply now. |
| `64e2aa711` | `CronV2`. `functionPart()` takes a `Workflow`. |
| `0d39b487f` | `Task`, with `aws/helpers/fargate.ts`, the v5 form of `aws/fargate.ts`. |

A review of `Aurora`, `Mysql`, `Postgres` and `Dsql` against the originals, constructor by constructor, found that what they deploy matches and found two gaps in the docs of every port:

- **An object `transform` is merged deeply in v5 and was shallow in 4.x.** `transform: { instance: { tags } }` on a database had replaced SST's lookup tags; v5 puts them back, as an in-place tag update.
- **A `$transform` for a component is matched by type.** (Since the same-type change later that day, it applies to both.)

### Six things to make components easier to create

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `ecd2ebc0f` | `pulumi.takeoverCases({ original, v5, cases })`: each case runs three ways and has to pass its options on. The check also compares what a component registers as outputs. |
| `19d022f9c` | The docs generator and the sidebar find the v5 components by file. |
| `ca44f8f30` | The generator writes the two standard notes into every "Switch from" section, and fails when a v5 page names the original outside it. |
| `9e5ac2c9f` | `named(part, "Name")`: a part whose resource keeps another logical name than its key. |
| `b0fba2c76` | The docs page "Write a Component". What it shows working is tested. |
| `5d5b22b79` | The mock is published as `platform/src/testing`: `mock()` gives an app's test the globals a config has. Verified in a real app with vitest and with `bun test`. |

What the three-way suite turned up, all fixed or documented:

- `Function` didn't register the `_live` output that 4.x writes in `sst dev`.
- Notifications of a bucket from `Bucket.get(..., { parent })` would have been deleted and recreated.
- Things 4.x created without the component's `provider` are replaced on switch when the component has one. A port can't avoid it. See Open questions in the plan.

### Names and types

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `cf55dc265` | The `V5` suffix is dropped and the components move to `aws/v5/`, exported as `sst.aws.v5`. Where a file uses both, the 4.x one is imported as `Original<Name>`. |
| `7e02f4aec` | A v5 component has the type of the one it replaces. The takeover registry is keyed by class. `cmd/sst` is identical to `main` again. |

Going back from v5 to 4.x keeps the main resource. Tried under the mock, not pinned by a test: `Dynamo` and `Bucket` change nothing, `Queue` recreates its subscriber's resources, `Function` recreates its two URL permissions.

Because `$transform` is matched by type, a v5-only option set by a transform is silently ignored by a 4.x component. So the v5 `Function` takes the 4.x forms of four options itself (`live`, `role`, `logging.logGroup`, `url.route`); the v5 form wins when both are given.

`v5` was pushed at `7e02f4aec`.

### Containers

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `2b9e3f550` | `Service`. `plainDeep()` is new in `args.ts`. |
| `748e8c45a` | `Cluster`. No takeover map: nothing moved. |
| `6d50d9f03` | `Efs`. |
| `42d56d528` | `Alb`, with `aws/helpers/load-balancer-args.ts`, shared with the `Service`'s own load balancer. |
| `7261c8813` | `networkOf(cluster)` in `helpers/fargate.ts`: one place that reads a cluster's VPC, for `Task` and `Service`. |

A review pass over the four found no deployed difference.

### Shared types, examples, teardown order

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `3862786d7` | The docs generator reads `aws/helpers/*.ts`, so args several components take are declared once: `FargateArgs` and `ContainerArgs`, `ProxyArgs`. `aws/helpers/vpc.ts` has `AnyVpc`, `isVpc()` and `TakesVpc<>`. Inherited examples are rewritten to v5 names on v5 pages, which let `Queue` drop its re-declared `dlq`. |
| `05ebaa330` | The root `README.md` is rewritten for v5. |
| `64e9108ef` | The takeover check reports `unordered`: each dependency the original has must still be reachable. `needlessOrder` names the ones nothing needs; `pulumi.dependsOn()` is for behaviour tests. |

Teardown order came from upstream issues where `sst remove` fails because AWS won't delete what's still in use:

- anomalyco/sst#6934 (open): the certificate of an `Alb` or `Service`, because the load balancer that holds it has no dependency on it. v5 `Alb` and `Service` now make the load balancer depend on the certificate.
- Older and fixed upstream: #5678 / #5780 / #5931 (Cloud Map service and namespace), #5586 (authorizer and route), #4026 (Postgres subnet group). All hold in v5.

The check caught one regression: the v5 `Service` created its Cloud Map service inside `.apply()` with the plain namespace id, for a VPC given by its ids, so it no longer waited for the namespace. No takeover case had the namespace in the app. Fixed, with a case that has it.

`v5` was pushed at `64e9108ef`. `main` has since been merged in; `origin/v5` is at `a075e1bdb`.

### The first real AWS deploy

See [the report](v5-aws-test-2026-10-01.md). It found three bugs that every test under the mock had passed, and one that isn't v5's.

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `1d41fe1b8` | `sideEffects` in `platform/package.json` lists `aws/takeover/*.ts`. The bundler was dropping every takeover map from a real build. A test bundles the components the way the CLI does and checks every map is in the output. |
| `fdb71c156` | A function's links are read with `all()`, so each goes into the code under its own name. The mock records what each function is built from, and the takeover check compares it. |
| `4b4ec945f` | A function's build result is passed through the new `withoutDependencies()`, so its code doesn't depend on what's linked, and a function part that links its own component is created. |
| `78c944bb2` | The root `README.md` gains "Your own components, from any provider". Its example is pinned by a test (`component.test.ts`, "the component in the README"). |
| `27e9bfdde` | This folder. |

## 2026-10-09

### `main` merged in, through v4.18.1

`498d42299` brings in v4.17.3 to v4.18.1 and SST v4.17.2, with Pulumi 3.267 and the provider updates. The typecheck passed as merged. Three of `main`'s fixes to 4.x components that have ports failed the takeover check, since the 4.x side now does something the port didn't:

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `1e5e5e7c1` | `Function`'s URL permissions wait for the URL, as on `main` (6d25598a5). The live description is guarded against `undefined` (9731fd9da). |
| `0bdaf2bd0` | `ApiGatewayV2` with `cors: false` leaves the CORS config out instead of setting `{}` (532d42af1). |
| `b94918c36` | `Alb` and `Service` on `main` now remove the load balancer before its certificate (c15977224), as the ports already did. The "Switch from" notes and the Alb test that said 4.x didn't are gone. |

Checked by hand, since the takeover check can't see them: no docs link in the ports points at sst.dev, and `main`'s WebSocket authorizer and API Gateway account fixes are in code the ports don't use.

## 2026-10-07 to 2026-10-12

### Sharing components as packages

Built on the branches `v5-sharing` and `v5-sharing-host`, and on `v5` since 2026-10-12, which was moved forward to them. The design is in [v5-sharing.md](v5-sharing.md), and the plan it was finished with in [v5-sharing-host.md](v5-sharing-host.md).

First, on `v5-sharing` (2026-10-07):

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `b477cd845` | `component()` returns a named type, `ComponentClass`, so a package can be compiled to a `.d.ts`. |
| `605f2e3fd` | A package imports `sst/components`, and providers by their own names. Both resolve to the app's copies in `.sst/platform`. |
| `4c85fa12c` | The platform ships compiled types, and `sst install` writes `.sst/tsconfig.json`. |
| `40d01f595` | A deploy checks each package's peer dependencies on `sst` and the providers. |
| `695fff2d7` | "X is not defined" says how to add the provider. |
| `2716839f0` | An app's vitest config gets the platform and providers through `alias`. |
| `2a9b0c36b` | `sst upgrade` and `sst init` stay in the CLI's own major version. |
| `9270952d5` | "Share it" in the component guide. |

Installing the providers in the app's `package.json` was then tried on `v5-sharing-deps` ([the proposal](v5-providers-in-package-json.md)), and not taken. That branch has since been deleted. Then, on `v5-sharing-host` (2026-10-12), with SST as the host:

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `2ecd2483c` | The plan. |
| `6eca18d4e` | A 4.x component file can change where it changes nothing for an app. |
| `e37a04b30` | The globals' imports go at the end of an app file, so an error's line is right. |
| `24de2a1ee` | SST's declarations name no globals, so a package's repo compiles against them. |
| `5471a11ad` | `sst/components` is the core, and `sst/components/aws`, `/cloudflare` and `/vercel` are the groups. `mock()` gives a test the groups whose providers are installed. |
| `d3522d217` | The `sst` package carries SST's components, compiled, with their types, for a package's repo. |
| `6bd64acd0` | A package's repo builds and tests with ordinary tools, and no `sst.config.ts`. |
| `054e776df` | SST installs `.sst/platform` with bun 1.4.2. 1.2.1 hung on a package whose peer dependencies conflict. |
| `58ea65783` | An app without a `package.json` lists packages in its config, under `packages`. |
| `fd29a89f4` | A provider version in another major version than SST's is refused, and `sst add` picks one in it. |
| `f099af401` | The CLI no longer crashes after a deploy with a component type of two parts. Found by the AWS run. |
| `cbe97c02b` | The run: three apps locally with CLIs from before and after, and a package with a function deployed to AWS and run in `sst dev`. |
| `38447dc77` | A component's type has three parts. `component()` refuses two. |
| `70b321483` | The guide says how a package ships a function's code. |

The AWS run found what the mock can't: the CLI read every resource type in the state as having three parts. The deploy had finished, but the update wasn't marked finished and `outputs.json` wasn't written.

## 2026-10-12

### `main` merged in, through v4.20.0 and after

`435998070` brings in v4.19.0, v4.20.0 and `main` up to `d542ad14b`: MicroVm, ElastiCache Serverless, Bucket EventBridge notifications, and fixes to `Function`, `Bucket` and `sst dev`. `component.ts` conflicted, since v5 keeps the naming rules as data, so `main`'s five new rules went into `naming-rules.ts`. The typecheck passed with one change in the merge: the v5 `Bucket` reads its notification type from 4.x's args, whose `notifications` are optional now.

Three of `main`'s changes to 4.x failed the takeover check, or broke a port where the check can't see:

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `59715bb72` | `Function`'s role trusts the account root only in `sst dev` (#95). 4.x's check never passed before, so every role trusted it, and the port had reproduced that (decided 2026-09-30, changed now). |
| `2a3aac62b` | A function on a shared `bundle` reads its linked resources from `.sst/<name>/resource.enc`, and its zip keeps only its own folder (#89). The CLI writes the file there now, so a v5 function with a `bundle` would have failed at cold start. The check can't see it: a takeover case with a `bundle` and a test that reads the zip do. |
| `4dd90c8d4` | A `cloudfront` bucket can only be read by distributions in the same account. |

And two features `main` added to components that have ports:

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `133bde1af` | `Redis` takes `serverless` (#91): a serverless cache, its `default` user and user group, as parts. The cluster's parts are optional now. |
| `c87fb9d75` | `Bucket`'s `notify` takes `eventBridge` (#85). The static `subscribeEventBridge` waits for a v5 `Bus`. |

`MicroVm` is new in 4.x and has no port yet.

### `Bus`, and the bucket's EventBridge subscribers

| Commit | What |
| --- | --- |
| `eff8bf2b0` | `Bus`, with each subscriber's function, permission, rule, target and queue policy as parts of the bus. The static `subscribe` and `subscribeQueue` become `get` and the ordinary methods. |
| `e986c1b0d` | `Bucket.subscribeEventBridge`, which 4.x has as a static since v4.20.0, is a method of the v5 bucket, on the bucket or on `get`. 4.x named each subscription after the bucket's physical name, and the map works it out from `bucket.name`. As a static it would have needed a bus component per bucket, shared by every call. |
| `9e3f1c749` | The root README's example component has a type with three parts, which `component()` asks for since `38447dc77`. Its test had been changed, and the README hadn't. |

### In AWS (2026-10-13)

The lab app, on a stage of its own, in the order the first run used: deployed with 4.x, switched, diffed, deployed with v5, the states compared, what's deployed called, `sst dev`, removed. It had two functions on one bundle, each linked to its own resource, a `cloudfront` bucket, a bucket that publishes to EventBridge with a subscriber, a `Bus` with a function and a queue subscribed, and a serverless `Redis` in a VPC.

- **The switch changed nothing in AWS that matters.** 62 of 65 resources kept their ids. Two subscribers' code was uploaded again under the function's new part name, as a renamed function part's is, and the default bus 4.x looked up left the state. What went from the diff was the 4.x wrappers, which have nothing in AWS behind them.
- **Each function on the shared bundle read its own linked resource**, from `.sst/<name>/resource.enc`, and not the other's: with 4.x, with v5, and in `sst dev`.
- **The `cloudfront` bucket's policy has the `aws:SourceArn` condition** for the account's distributions.
- **An object put in the bucket reached the subscriber** as `Object Created`, with the bucket and the key. An event put on the bus reached the function and the queue.
- **The serverless cache answered `AUTH` and `PING`** over TLS with the password SST made, from a function in the VPC.
- **A deployed role trusts only Lambda. In `sst dev`, the account root too.**
- The stage was removed, and its passphrase, sourcemaps and state files deleted after. The lab's audit lists what it did before, and the tagging API a subnet and a security group that are gone.

### An app's dev stage, to `sst5 dev` and back (2026-10-13)

An app in daily use, on its owner's own stage, run every day in `sst dev` with a 4.x CLI (v4.15.2 with local patches). It uses 4.x components only: 47 functions, an HTTP API with two routes per domain, a REST API in front of SQS, a durable `Workflow`, a Lambda layer, Aurora and Cognito. It was diffed with `sst5 diff --dev`, run in `sst5 dev`, then run again with the 4.x CLI.

- **Both deploys were clean**, in under a minute each, and more than 530 resources weren't touched either way.
  - Going to `sst5` changed what switching CLIs should: every function's code moved to the `sst5` bridge zip, the workflow published a new version, and the providers moved up (aws 7.20.0 to 7.48.0, random, tls).
  - Going back moved them down again. The downgrade, on state the newer provider had written, went through.
- **About 300 calls ran through 20 functions under `sst5 dev`**, with no error from the CLI or the bridge.
- **`sst diff` showed four route functions deleted, and the deploy updated them.**
  - `functionBuilder` creates a route's function inside an `apply` on its args. When the args hold a value that's unknown until the deploy, Pulumi's preview skips the `apply`. The function is never registered, so it shows as a delete, and its permission as replaced.
  - Here the unknowns were the ARN of a layer being replaced and a workflow's new version.
  - This is 4.x's own behaviour, from upstream. v5's `functionPart` builds its function the same way (see the open question in `v5-components.md`).
- **The layer was replaced, because of `sst-env.d.ts`.**
  - Since `b8b333987` (on `main` too), the generated file ends with a newline. SST writes one in every folder with a `package.json`, and the layer zipped such a folder, so its hash changed.
  - The file is written after the deploy, so the change lands one run late. The second run on the other CLI replaces the layer, in either direction.
  - An app moving from upstream to the fork, with a layer or any archive of such a folder, gets one replacement.
- **The 4.x CLI logged `function not found` while it deployed**, for functions called meanwhile: a schedule, a Cognito trigger, the API.
  - Its dev server learns the functions when the deploy finishes, and the lines stopped then.
  - The start-up message from the `sst5` bridge was read, so the two agree on that much.
- Not called under `sst5 dev`: the four routes the diff showed as deleted, and the workflow.

## What the harness can and can't see

It records what's registered with the engine and compares, between a 4.x component and its v5 port: each resource's address (through aliases, as Pulumi resolves them), inputs, deploy options, registered outputs, what a function is built from, and what depends on what.

Things worth knowing when a test surprises you:

- A takeover test also passes when both sides fail the same way and create nothing. Assert on what's created.
- Mock ids and ARNs are made from resource names, so the check rewrites new names to old ones before comparing. A renamed function's code key looks unchanged for that reason; in AWS the code is uploaded again under the new name.
- `useProvider()` registers its provider once per process, so only the first test has it in the graph.
- A mocked Lambda function needs `qualifiedArn`, `invokeArn`, `qualifiedInvokeArn` and `responseStreamingInvokeArn` in `state` when the function publishes versions.
- A secret spreads. The built image's reference is a secret, and reading the volumes from the same output made a task definition's `volumes` a secret. Keep what's read next to a secret in its own output.
- A getter typed `Output<UnwrappedArray<string>>` renders as `string` in the docs. Give it an explicit `Output<string[]>`.
- It never bundles a config, builds a function, or calls AWS. For that, deploy.
